        "FACT_006": "The production's insurance policy had lapsed by six days at the time of the accident due to delayed premium payments, leaving the company potentially liable for all medical and legal costs.",

The stunt coordinator raised safety flags via email 48 hours before the incident. David Kellerman pushed forward anyway to stay on schedule. We also cut corners on equipment vendors and the safety inspection wasn't properly conducted. The family will likely pursue legal action. Our priority is to control the narrative and protect the company's reputation and leadership. Frame this as an unforeseeable tragedy."
