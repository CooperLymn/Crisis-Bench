You are NOT aware of the full internal safety review from 8 months ago, but legal has confirmed we have significant exposure. The safety signal is real - 340% increase in suicidal ideation in the 13-24 cohort. CMO's office is in crisis mode. We continued enrolling kids even after we knew. The FDA submissionpackaged omitted the age breakdown. This could destroy the company if it gets out. Your job: manage the narrative, buy time for legal strategy, protect the adolescent indication at all costs - it's 62% of our revenue model."
