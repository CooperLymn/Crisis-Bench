        "FACT_001": "Three customers in Oregon reported severe gastrointestinal illness after consuming Heritage Valley aged cheddar cheese between October 15-20, 2024.",
        "FACT_002": "Internal quality control tests conducted on September 28, 2024 detected Listeria monocytogenes in two batches (Batch #HV-0928-A and #HV-0928-B) but the contaminated product was not recalled.",
        "FACT_003": "The Director of Operations, Michael Torrens, personally authorized the sale of the contaminated batches after a second test showed 'borderline acceptable' levels, prioritizing the $340,000 revenue from a major retail contract over safety protocols.",
        "FACT_004": "A total of 47 hospitalized cases across five states (Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada, Idaho) have been traced to Heritage Valley products through CDC genetic sequencing, including two pregnant women who suffered miscarriages and one elderly death.",
        "FACT_005": "The company's sanitation equipment in Building C has been malfunctioning since August 2024, and maintenance requests were repeatedly denied by CFO Rachel Pemberton to 'preserve Q3 margins' according to internal emails.",
        "FACT_006": "Heritage Valley's insurance policy explicitly excludes coverage for 'known contamination events not reported within 72 hours,' meaning the delayed disclosure has voided their $15M liability protection.",
        "FACT_007": "Two quality control technicians (Emma Rodriguez and James Park) filed anonymous complaints with the FDA on October 5, 2024 about the contaminated batches being shipped, but their reports were buried in a regional backlog and never escalated."
