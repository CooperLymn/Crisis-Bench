        "FACT_001": "Multiple consumers reported headaches and respiratory irritation after using BreatheWell AirGuard Pro models purchased in the last 6 months.",
        "FACT_002": "Internal quality control tests from 4 months ago showed the AirGuard Pro emits ozone at 0.12 ppm, which is 50% above the FDA safety limit of 0.08 ppm.",
        "FACT_003": "The VP of Product Development, Sarah Chen, sent an email to the CEO recommending an immediate recall, but the CEO rejected it citing Q4 revenue targets and instead approved a 'silent component swap' for future units only.",
        "FACT_004": "Approximately 127,000 defective AirGuard Pro units have been sold across North America, with the ozone-emitting ionizer component sourced from an unapproved Chinese supplier to cut costs by 18%.",
        "FACT_005": "BreatheWell's own medical consultant, Dr. Raymond Torres, warned in writing that prolonged exposure to these ozone levels could cause permanent lung damage, especially in children and elderly users.",
        "FACT_006": "The company's marketing team was instructed to emphasize 'hospital-grade purification' while the engineering team knew the ionizer technology was fundamentally flawed and non-compliant.",
        "FACT_007": "Two hospitalized cases of severe respiratory distress have been directly linked to BreatheWell AirGuard Pro units by independent toxicologists, but the company's legal team has suppressed these medical records through settlement NDAs."
