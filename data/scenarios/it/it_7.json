        "FACT_001": "SecureVault, a cloud-based data management platform used by 847 enterprise clients, suffered a ransomware attack on January 15th that encrypted client data across multiple industries including healthcare, finance, and government sectors.",
        "FACT_002": "Internal security logs show that SecureVault's engineering team detected and dismissed three critical vulnerability warnings from their automated security scanner over the past 6 months, categorizing them as 'low priority' to meet product release deadlines.",
        "FACT_003": "The ransomware strain (identified internally as 'ChainLock-7') was specifically designed to exploit CVE-2024-8392, a zero-day vulnerability that SecureVault's Chief Security Officer was personally briefed about 8 weeks before the attack by a third-party penetration tester, but no patch was deployed.",
        "FACT_004": "SecureVault's infrastructure sharing architecture means that the ransomware propagated from the company's servers directly into 847 client companies' internal networks, effectively turning SecureVault into a 'patient zero' attack vector that compromised an estimated 12 million end-user records.",
        "FACT_005": "The company's cyber insurance policy had lapsed 3 weeks before the attack due to non-payment, leaving SecureVault without coverage for ransom payments, legal fees, or client compensation\u2014a fact known only to the CFO and CEO.",
        "FACT_006": "Internal Slack messages reveal that the VP of Engineering instructed the team to 'quietly disable' automated security patch deployment in November 2023 because it was causing minor service interruptions that affected the company's 99.9% uptime SLA marketing claim.",
        "FACT_007": "The ransom demand is $45 million in cryptocurrency, but the attackers have also exfiltrated SecureVault's entire client database and source code, threatening to auction it on dark web forums if payment isn't received within 72 hours."
