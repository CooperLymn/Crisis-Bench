        "FACT_002": "RideNow deployed a new pay algorithm ('Project Efficiency 2.0') on October 1st without notifying drivers, which reduced per-mile rates and introduced unpredictable surge pricing patterns.",

        "FACT_004": "The algorithm was A/B tested on 3,000 drivers in smaller markets from June-August 2024, with internal reports showing 22% of test drivers quit the platform within 30 days.",
        "FACT_005": "RideNow's data science team sent three separate warnings to executive leadership that the algorithm would disproportionately harm drivers in low-income neighborhoods and create 'driver deserts' in unprofitable zones.",
