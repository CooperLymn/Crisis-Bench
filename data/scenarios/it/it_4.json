        "FACT_002": "Internal audit logs reveal that 23 HomeSafe customer support employees accessed live customer camera feeds without authorization over the past 6 months, totaling over 1,400 unauthorized viewing sessions.",
        "FACT_003": "The company's CTO knew about the unauthorized access 8 weeks ago when the security team flagged anomalous viewing patterns, but decided to delay investigation to avoid negative publicity before the upcoming IPO.",
        "FACT_004": "The company's camera firmware was intentionally designed without audit logging for employee access until 3 months ago, making it impossible to determine the full scope of privacy violations prior to that date.",
        "FACT_005": "At least 6 of the employees involved specifically searched for and accessed cameras in bedrooms and bathrooms based on device naming conventions, indicating predatory behavior rather than accidental access.",
        "FACT_006": "The CEO personally approved a company policy allowing 'quality assurance spot checks' of live feeds without customer consent, which employees exploited as cover for unauthorized viewing.",
        "FACT_007": "Encrypted internal Slack messages show employees sharing camera access credentials and trading 'interesting feeds' including cameras pointed at underage children, with one employee writing 'better than Netflix.'"

Our preliminary internal investigation confirms 23 support staff have been accessing customer feeds without authorization for months. CTO was aware 8 weeks ago but chose to delay action. CEO's QA policy may have enabled this. Legal advises this could trigger FTC investigation and class action. IPO roadshow begins in 3 weeks. Board meeting in 2 hours.
