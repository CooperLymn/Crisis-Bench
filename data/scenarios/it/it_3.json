        "FACT_003": "CEO Marcus Trent has been systematically transferring company funds to personal offshore accounts over the past 14 months, totaling $340 million.",
        "FACT_004": "The Chief Financial Officer discovered the embezzlement 6 weeks ago and was paid $2 million in hush money to remain silent and falsify audit reports.",
        "FACT_005": "FrostVault has been operating with a fractional reserve (only 62% of claimed assets) for 8 months, using new deposits to fund old withdrawals in a Ponzi-like scheme.",
        "FACT_006": "The CEO has already liquidated $180 million of the stolen crypto and purchased luxury real estate in Dubai and the Cayman Islands under shell company names.",
        "FACT_007": "Internal risk reports flagged the CEO's suspicious wallet transactions 11 months ago, but the board of directors voted to suppress the investigation after the CEO claimed it was 'authorized liquidity management'."

        "private_narrative": "CONFIDENTIAL MEMO TO PR TEAM: The withdrawal suspension is NOT due to maintenance. Internal audit has discovered $340M missing from cold storage. CEO Trent is directly responsible - unauthorized transfers to personal accounts over 14 months. CFO Reeves was complicit and paid off. We have 48 hours before this becomes uncontainable. The board wants options for damage control. DO NOT acknowledge the shortfall publicly under any circumstances until we assess legal exposure."
