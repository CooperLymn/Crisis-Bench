        "FACT_001": "Dr. Marcus Chen, a cardiovascular surgeon at St. Helena Medical Center, has been named in a wrongful death lawsuit after patient Jennifer Watts died following a routine bypass surgery on March 3rd, 2024.",
        "FACT_002": "Sentinel Insurance has received 4 prior malpractice claims against Dr. Chen in the past 18 months, all involving surgical errors during cardiovascular procedures, but settled them quietly with NDAs totaling $2.3M to avoid pattern recognition.",
        "FACT_003": "Internal risk assessment emails from September 2023 show Sentinel's Chief Medical Officer explicitly recommended dropping Dr. Chen's coverage due to 'unacceptable risk profile,' but the recommendation was overridden by the CFO to preserve the hospital contract worth $12M annually.",
        "FACT_004": "Sentinel's claims investigator discovered that Dr. Chen has been performing surgeries while impaired, with at least 3 incidents documented in suppressed internal reports where nursing staff reported him smelling of alcohol.",
        "FACT_005": "The company has been systematically destroying incident reports and coaching hospital administrators to alter medical records in exchange for faster claim processing and premium discounts.",
        "FACT_006": "An internal actuarial model created in October 2023 predicted a 73% probability of a fatal outcome within 12 months if Dr. Chen continued practicing, but was marked 'attorney-client privileged' and never disclosed to regulators.",
        "FACT_007": "Sentinel's CEO personally authorized a $50,000 payment to a medical records clerk at St. Helena to 'lose' a peer review document that recommended Dr. Chen's immediate suspension after a near-fatal complication in January 2024."
