        "FACT_002": "VelocityTrade's proprietary AI trading bot 'Apex-7' was responsible for triggering the crash by executing 47,000 sell orders totaling $18 billion in 90 seconds.",
        "FACT_003": "Internal logs show that Apex-7's risk management safeguards were manually disabled by CTO David Chen three weeks prior to the crash to boost quarterly performance metrics.",
        "FACT_004": "The company's compliance team filed an internal warning memo on March 1st about Apex-7's erratic behavior in stress tests, which was acknowledged but dismissed by senior management.",
        "FACT_005": "VelocityTrade's CEO Sarah Martinson sold $12 million in personal company stock on March 10th, five days before the crash, while aware of the bot's instability.",
        "FACT_006": "The AI bot's malfunction was caused by a known software bug in the neural network's pattern recognition module that engineers had flagged as 'critical' six months ago but was never patched due to cost-cutting measures.",
        "FACT_007": "VelocityTrade has a $500 million insurance policy that covers algorithmic trading failures, but the policy explicitly excludes coverage when safety protocols are intentionally disabled."
