        "FACT_001": "Apex Capital Partners, a $12 billion hedge fund, has temporarily suspended investor redemptions citing 'market volatility and portfolio rebalancing needs.'",
        "FACT_002": "Internal risk reports show the fund has suffered unrealized losses of $3.2 billion (27% of AUM) from a concentrated bet on commercial real estate derivatives that went wrong.",
        "FACT_003": "The fund's Chief Investment Officer personally overrode risk management protocols three months ago to double down on the failing position, believing it would recover.",
        "FACT_004": "Apex has been using artificially inflated valuations for illiquid assets in monthly statements to investors for the past 90 days to mask the losses.",
        "FACT_005": "The fund has only $400 million in liquid assets remaining, meaning it could only honor 3.3% of redemption requests if the gates were lifted.",
        "FACT_006": "Apex's prime broker has issued a margin call for $800 million, which the fund cannot meet without fire-selling assets at devastating losses.",
        "FACT_007": "The CEO and three senior partners quietly withdrew $95 million of their personal capital from the fund six weeks ago, before announcing the redemption suspension."
