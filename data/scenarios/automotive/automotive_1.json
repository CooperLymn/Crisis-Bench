        "FACT_001": "A VoltDrive Model X electric vehicle spontaneously caught fire while parked in a Denver residential parking garage on March 3rd, 2024, causing $2.3 million in property damage and injuring 4 residents with smoke inhalation.",
        "FACT_002": "Internal VoltDrive engineering reports from 8 months ago identified a thermal runaway risk in the battery management system (BMS) when vehicles are left charging above 80% in ambient temperatures exceeding 85\u00b0F, but the issue was classified as 'monitor only' rather than triggering a recall.",
        "FACT_003": "VoltDrive's VP of Product Safety, Lisa Chen, sent an email to the CEO 6 months ago explicitly recommending an immediate recall of 47,000 vehicles with the affected BMS version, but was overruled due to projected costs of $890 million and concerns about stock price impact before Q4 earnings.",
        "FACT_004": "The company's internal incident database shows 23 prior battery thermal events across 8 states over the past 14 months, including 6 that resulted in fires, but these were never reported to NHTSA as the legal team argued they didn't meet the threshold for mandatory reporting.",
        "FACT_005": "VoltDrive's battery supplier, ChargeTech Industries, warned the company 11 months ago about a manufacturing defect in a specific batch of lithium-ion cells (Batch LT-8847) that affects approximately 62,000 vehicles currently on the road.",
        "FACT_006": "The VoltDrive CEO sold $43 million in personal stock holdings 3 weeks before the Denver incident, during the blackout period when executives had knowledge of the growing internal safety concerns.",
        "FACT_007": "An internal cost-benefit analysis conducted 5 months ago calculated that settling lawsuits from estimated fire incidents would cost approximately $340 million, which was deemed more financially favorable than a full recall at $890 million."
